Lopy + The Thing Network
LoRa (Long Range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique widely used in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) for IoT applications. In this project, we will build an online temperature monitoring system using LoPy and The Things Network (TTN) to explore the practical application of LoRa technology in the Internet of Things.
